But to succed you have two weapons your memory and your chance.
When the Game start, all players around the table receive fourth cards (two at top and two at bottom). and you watch the two cards at top before the begin of the party. 
From that your goal will be to have the game with the most little value.
In front of you, you have one pack of cards (returned) and the cemetery. take a card on the top of the pack or the cimetery and change this card with one of your card. Then drop the card echanged in the cimetery. You can also don't exchange cards and drop the card who you take in the cimetery directly if you've take your card in the pack.
When you think have the game with the most little value, say Pablo. From that, the "tour" will be finished and all cards will be return.
If you have the game with the most little value, you win and you have 0 points, the others players will have points corresponding with the value of their hand.
