# Pablo

# Kind of game
Pablo is a card game

# Rules
Like every games, the goal of Pablo is the win.
But to succed you have two weapons your memory and your chance.
When the Game start, all players around the table receive fourth cards (two at top and two at bottom). and you watch the two cards at top before the begin of the party. 
From that your goal will be to have the game with the most little value.
In front of you, you have one pack of cards (returned) and the cemetery. take a card on the top of the pack or the cimetery and change this card with one of your card. Then drop the card echanged in the cimetery. You can also don't exchange cards and drop the card who you take in the cimetery directly if you've take your card in the pack.
When you think have the game with the most little value, say Pablo. From that, the "tour" will be finished and all cards will be return.
If you have the game with the most little value, you win and you have 0 points, the others players will have points corresponding with the value of their hand.
However in this game, some cards have special effect. 
## List of cards with their value and their effects
* card from Ace to 10 : their numbers (1 for the Ace)
* King of Spades : 0 points
* Jack and Queen and others Kings : 10 points

# Requirement
Actually you need to install the game from the source, you need to have an up-date-compiler C++ and the SFML 2.4.2 

Executables comming soon

# Note for compiling the project
If you use code::block like compiler, you need to compile the SFML on yourself with CMake
